"Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained."

Somehow I managed to stretch canvas and secure waterproof  hatch covers across the gaping holes. Some water continued to  stream below, but most of it was now being deflected over the side.  More problems arose when our hand pumps started to block  up with the debris floating around the cabins and the electric  pump short-circuited. The water level rose threateningly. Back  on deck I found that our two spare hand pumps had been  wrenched overboard — along with the forestay sail, the jib, the  dinghies and the main anchor.  Then I remembered we had another electric pump under  the chartroom floor. I connected it to an out-pipe, and was  thankful to find that it worked.
